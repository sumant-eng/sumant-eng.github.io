<h5 id="paul-morphy">Paul Morphy</h5>
<p>You must attend the course &ldquo;How to play like Paul Morphy&rdquo; if you are a beginner to the game of chess or are just a big fan of his style of play! Learning his style will educate you to be a player with the healthiest and strongest fundamentals in chess.</p>
<p>I have not yet come across a chess protegee that has not heard of the genius of Paul Morphy. I was 11 years old when I first came across Paul Morphy&rsquo;s name. It happened by chance as I was browsing the internet for the most dominant chess player with the highest win-rate.</p>
<p>I remember studying his games and repeatedly come to the conclusion that he must be the strongest player of all time! I did not particularly enjoy Fischer&rsquo;s or Karpov&rsquo;s games when I was a child as they were too complicated for me to understand and draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>Experienced players always stress the importance of starting off in the sport of chess with solid fundamental principles. Learning from Paul Morphyâ€™s games will definitely help you achieve that!</p>
