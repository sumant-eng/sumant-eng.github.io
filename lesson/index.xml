      <description>Mikhail Tal, 1968
  About this course Mikhail Tal This course &amp;ldquo;How to play like Mikhail Tal&amp;rdquo; will teach you how to develop your imagination and intuition in chess as well as improve your ability to calculate variations in complicated positions.
I have been called the &amp;ldquo;Malaysian Tal&amp;rdquo; by many players. The 2 most popular games I have played which closely resemble Tal&amp;rsquo;s style of play are my games against Edward Lee in 2008 and against Perez Gormaz, Matias in 2016 where I seemed to pay no regard to material balance yet with the result ending in my favour.</description>

      <description>Jose Raul Capablanca
  About this course Jose Raul Capablanca In this course “How to play like Capablanca” you will learn to master simple positions.
A chess prodigy from Cuba, Capablanca is widely known for his amazing endgame skills and his mastery of simple positions. He preferred to only spend time thinking about what he would do in critical positions instead of calculating long variations.
By learning his style of play, you will be better able to identify critical positions in your own games and learn how to strategize plans which you would then follow through until the end without too many variations.</description>

      <description>Alekhine vs. Euwe, 1937
  About this course Alexander Alekhine A world champion well known for his fierce and imaginative attacking style that sometimes involves crazy sacrifices.
What set him apart from other attackers is his ability to sense attacking chances in a position that may seem completely docile for others. An explanation offered by Réti was, &amp;ldquo;he beats his opponents by analysing simple and apparently harmless sequences of moves in order to see whether at some time or another at the end of it an original possibility, and therefore one difficult to see, might be hidden.</description>
