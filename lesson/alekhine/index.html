  About this course Alexander Alekhine A world champion well known for his fierce and imaginative attacking style that sometimes involves crazy sacrifices.
What set him apart from other attackers is his ability to sense attacking chances in a position that may seem completely docile for others.

<h5 id="alexander-alekhine">Alexander Alekhine</h5>
<p>A world champion well known for his fierce and imaginative attacking style that sometimes involves crazy sacrifices.</p>
<p>What set him apart from other attackers is his ability to sense attacking chances in a position that may seem completely docile for others. An explanation offered by Réti was, &ldquo;he beats his opponents by analysing simple and apparently harmless sequences of moves in order to see whether at some time or another at the end of it an original possibility, and therefore one difficult to see, might be hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he meant by that is that he would always calculate to the best of his ability to get into positions that offer the most amazing array of original ways to handle the position; of course he would have seen the resulting positions beforehand and convert to an advantage that leaves his opponents flabbergasted.</p>
<p>Alekhine’s traits, which you will learn to employ in your own game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super analytical</li>
<li>Creative, always striving to create something out of nothing</li>
<li>Psychological warfare against opponents (leads them into original positions that he knows he can handle much better than his opponents no matter what the objective evaluation of the position is)</li>
<li>Ability to provoke opponents into making errors without taking unnecessary risks</li>
<li>His attacking play is based off very solid positional foundations</li>
<li>Insane desire to win (proven by the high average length of his drawn games)</li>
</ul>
