I learned how to play chess since I was seven years old. I have played in many competitions since then.
My best success was winning the Malaysian Masters in 2016. It was the toughest chess competition in the country where ten of the strongest national players are competing in a 9-round tournament.
By retaining status as amongst the elite players in the country, I represented Malaysia three times at the World Chess Olympiad Championships." />

<p>I am currently working on chess development for improving players.</p>
<p>I learned how to play chess since I was seven years old. I have played in many competitions since then.</p>
<p>My best success was winning the Malaysian Masters in 2016. It was the toughest chess competition in the country where ten of the strongest national players are competing in a 9-round tournament.</p>
<p>By retaining status as amongst the elite players in the country, I represented Malaysia three times at the World Chess Olympiad Championships.</p>

<p>In the 2019 SEA Games, I was appointed as National Coach by the Malaysian Chess Federation and the Olympic Council of Malaysia to formulate a strategy for winning some medals. The team created a history for winning the first Gold for Malaysia in chess after IM Yeoh Li Tian surpassed other competitors from various countries in the Open event. Malaysia has never won in any chess event at the SEA Games before this edition.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am a FIDE Master and certified FIDE Trainer. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) recognized my achievement in chess sport by awarding the FIDE Master title in 2016. A year later, FIDE had also certified me as a qualified chess trainer and granted the FIDE Trainer title.</p>
