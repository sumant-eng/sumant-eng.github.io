<h5 id="mikhail-botvinnik">Mikhail Botvinnik</h5>
<p>The world champion that perfected the scientific method of chess. A world champion who was at the top of the world for nearly 30 years! He held the world champion title for the second longest period of time, only behind Kasparov.</p>
<p>In this course “How to play like Mikhail Botvinnik”, you will learn how to maintain a small and compact opening repertoire that focuses on depth of variations and how to derive examples from the play of others in similar situations to maintain familiarity of the resulting positions however your opponent chooses to play. This &ldquo;familiarity&rdquo; will help you in dealing with any position that results from your opening repertoire easily and without worry.</p>
<p>Botvinnik generally sought tense positions and dynamic play with chances for both sides.
He had a strong grasp of long-term strategy, and was often willing to accept weaknesses that his opponent could not exploit in exchange for some advantage that he could exploit.</p>
<p>The greatest thing to learn from his games are the positional sacrifices he made and what type of positions he aspired from them. One of the most versatile and all-rounder in contrast to other world champions who had distinctive styles with which they conducted themselves almost exclusively i.e. Tal (aggressive and all-out attacking) and Tigran Petrosian (excellent defender and positional squeezer - akin to a boa constrictor)</p>
<p>The valuable thing he taught in his school to famous pupils of his (Kasparov, Karpov etc.) was about tournament preparation that included regular but moderate physical excercise to stay in shape physically, which unsurprisingly translates to amazing mental stamina and resilience. He also taught them the benefits of maintaining a narrow but in-depth opening repertoire.</p>
<p>Openings (no cheap tricks - only works once or twice)</p>
<ul>
<li>system that is universal with clear understanding of the structure and typical positions that arise out of it</li>
<li>His advice to his pupils included &ldquo;My theory of the openings fitted into one notebook&rdquo; and
&ldquo;You don’t have to know that which everyone knows, but it is important to know that which not everyone knows”</li>
</ul>
