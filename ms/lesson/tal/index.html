  About this course Mikhail Tal This course &ldquo;How to play like Mikhail Tal&rdquo; will teach you how to develop your imagination and intuition in chess as well as improve your ability to calculate variations in complicated positions.
I have been called the &ldquo;Malaysian Tal&rdquo; by many players. The 2 most popular games I have played which closely resemble Tal&rsquo;s style of play are my games against Edward Lee in 2008 and against Perez Gormaz, Matias in 2016 where I seemed to pay no regard to material balance yet with the result ending in my favour." />

<p>This course &ldquo;How to play like Mikhail Tal&rdquo; will teach you how to develop your imagination and intuition in chess as well as improve your ability to calculate variations in complicated positions.</p>
<p>I have been called the &ldquo;Malaysian Tal&rdquo; by many players. The 2 most popular games I have played which closely resemble Tal&rsquo;s style of play are my games against Edward Lee in 2008 and against Perez Gormaz, Matias in 2016 where I seemed to pay no regard to material balance yet with the result ending in my favour.</p>
<p>Tal was brilliant and his attacking style awed everyone. His world class opponents feared him more than they did anyone else, resulting in him dominating most of the elite level events during his reign.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Misha&rsquo; as he was fondly known was a skilled piano player himself, and was most probably striving to create the perfect symphony in every game of chess he played.</p>
